# MyCapstone

This capstone project builds a regressions to predict the humidity based on temperature coastal reasing.

## Overview

Over the course of a week, scientists collected humidity readings during medium temperature days in northern California.

## Methods

Scientists used a raspberry pi with a temperature and humidity reader and placed them in sand dunes 100 meters, 50 meters, and 20 meters from the ocean and collected measurements.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks contain analytical code.

### regression.ipynb

This notebook contains the code to read the regression data, buils a linear model, and create a line plot.

## Data

The data directory contains th following files:

### regression.csv
